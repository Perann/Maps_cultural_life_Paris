L'officiel des théâtres is a french website on which you can find all the plays in Paris for the current season. 
The problem was that there are 43 pages of plays. Therefore we made a code in two parts. 

1- We find the number of pages (43) and we scrap all the url-links and stock them in a dictionary 

2- We run a second code that scarp each page and save the information in a csv file named "DataTheatre"
