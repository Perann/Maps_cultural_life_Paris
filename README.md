# A map of Paris cultural life
The goal of this project is to code an algorithm that does webscrapping to collect all datas about events happening each evening in Paris. Then it produces a map to let you know what you can do tonight.
The places considered in the code are:
- Theatre
- Concert hall
- Jazz club
- Cinema
- Opera
- Museum
