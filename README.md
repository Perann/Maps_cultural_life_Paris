# Description of our project

Our algorithm lets you choose the type of activity you want to attend: theatre, movies, concert.
Next you choose the date and the hours you are aviable.
In the end it displays you a map of Paris with markers on the establishments that have an event on the day and the hours you chose. Clicking on the marker provides you additional information about the place: the name, address, event details and average price. 


# Structure of this github

4 folders are dedicated to the main kind of activities we help you to find: theatres, movie theatre, concert hall and musical bar. In each of them, you will find our code that scraps some websites to find the names of the establishments, their addresses and their schedule. If you are only interested in viewing the map, you will just have to go in the folder Map

1 folder 'Outputs' in which you will find the databases we created after scrapping and cleaning the data from internet.


# Python's Modules:

In each folder, you will find a readme file that provides information on the modules you will have to import to run the code.
