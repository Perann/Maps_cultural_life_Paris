This section aims at finding all the theatres and Opera houses in Paris and displaying them on a map with markers that show the name of the establishment, the play you can attend, the price and the address. 

Our work is divided in three steps:
1- We scrap all the information on the wikipedia page "liste des théâtres et opéras de Paris" where we can find all the name of the theatres and there addresse. In order to prevent any change in the structure of the original page, we saved the information in a csv file

2- We scrap all the information on the website "L'officiel des théâtres" on which you can find all the plays, their dates and prices in paris from now on until june 24. 

3- Cleaning the data from the second step to generate a final base with all the information that will be displayed on the map.
